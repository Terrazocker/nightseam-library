# Windows catalog development environment

The independent repository uses Python/FastAPI, pywebview, Node source checks
and Playwright with system Chrome for private packaged-app browser tests.
.venv-build was moved with the application and can be reused through its own
Scripts/python.exe; build outputs may contain stale original-root paths and
must be regenerated before use.

The restricted sandbox may deny Chromium named pipes, Playwright startup or
cleanup of directories created under earlier ACL tokens. Use an elevated gate
when necessary, keep temporary files under ignored logs/, and report launch
failure as exit 2. Do not kill or close a user's application to run tests.

Tests patch archive/data/window-placement paths to ignored private locations.
Source and packaged libraries moved independently and must never be used by
tests. File operations check resolved roots and refuse links before recursive
movement/removal. Explicit UTF-8 without BOM is required for shipped text.

Git local maintenance.auto=false and gc.auto=0 prevent background maintenance
problems. No remote repository was configured during the split.
